# Face_Mask_Detection
This project focuses on creating a deep learning model to determine if people are wearing face masks. It uses a dataset with images of individuals both with and without masks. These images are resized to 128×128, converted to RGB, and labeled properly.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with TensorFlow/Keras to sort images into two groups: “With Mask” and “Without Mask.” The model is assessed for accuracy and tested with sample images. OpenCV is also used to show predictions and present test results in the notebook.
